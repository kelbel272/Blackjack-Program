# Blackjack-Program

Assignment:  Create a Blackjack (21) game. 
Your version of the game will imagine only a SINGLE suit of cards, 
so 13 unique cards, {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A}. 

Upon starting, you will be given two cards from the set, non-repeating. 

Your program MUST then tell you the odds of receiving a beneficial card 
(that would put your value at 21 or less), 
and the odds of receiving a detrimental card (that would put your value over 21). 

Recall that the J, Q, and K cards are worth ‘10’ points, the A card can be worth either ‘1’ or ‘11’ points, 
and the other cards are worth their numerical values.

FOR YOUR ASSIGNMENT: Provide two screenshots, one in which the game suggests it’s a good idea 
to get an extra card and the result, and one in which the game suggests it’s a bad idea to get
an extra card, and the result of taking that extra card.
