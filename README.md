## Assignment instructions
Create a Blackjack (21) game. 

Your version of the game will have only a SINGLE suit of cards, 
so 13 unique cards, {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A}. 

Upon starting, you will be given two cards from the set, non-repeating. 

Your program MUST then tell you the odds of receiving a beneficial card 
(that would put your value at 21 or less), 
and the odds of receiving a detrimental card (that would put your value over 21).
